Backend (Node.js and Express):
Setup:

Initialize a Node.js project and install necessary packages.
Use Express.js to create a server.
API Integration:

Utilize the provided code segments for connecting to the text-to-image API.
Implement routes to handle user requests and interact with the API.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling for failed API calls or internal errors.
Return appropriate responses to the client.
Frontend (React.js):
Setup:

Create a React app using create-react-app or similar tools.
UI Design:

Design a user-friendly UI with a form for inputting text for each panel.
Include a display area for the generated comic panels.
Form Handling:

Manage state using React hooks to handle form input for each panel.
API Integration:

Use fetch or a library like Axios to send requests to the backend API.
Error Handling:

Display user-friendly error messages for failed API calls or internal errors.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the application is responsive and functional on both desktop and mobile browsers.
Database (MongoDB):
Setup:
Set up a MongoDB database to store user data (optional, depending on your application requirements).
Bonus Features (Optional):
Speech Bubbles:
Implement a feature that allows users to add speech bubbles or text annotations on the images.
Deployment:
Deploy the backend (Node.js and Express) to a server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or any other hosting provider).
Deploy the frontend (React.js) to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
This is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation details will depend on the specific technologies and libraries you choose. Ensure that your code is well-documented, follows best practices, and handles potential edge cases. Finally, use version control (e.g., Git) to manage your codebase and provide a GitHub repository link as part of your submission.
